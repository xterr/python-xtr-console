"""This directory holds the package's recipe: its manifest.

The recipe is what *Use in an application* in the README lists, written as
data: the bundle to list, and the steps only a person can take — an entry
point is application code, so a recipe says what to write rather than writing
it. An application applies it with ``xtr-recipes recipes:sync``, which finds
this module through the ``xtr_recipes`` entry point.

Nothing is importable from here. The manifest is read as a file, so a recipe
is the same from a wheel as from a working tree.
